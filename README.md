# RGBoomBox

The RGBBoomBox is a bluetooth speaker with BLINKENLIGHTS

**6/24 update** I'm reworking and completing this project now based around an Arduino MEGA board. Ideally, the first iteration will be designed as a shield for the mega which the daughter components plug into. After that, it will be revamped into a single board.
